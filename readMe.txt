How to use You should run the mainprogram.m file

1. Problem variable contains the name of the dataset
2. Datasets are already placed in the P-Data folder
3. The output will be produced automatically as a result.csv file

NOTE: There are multiple versions of the approach if you want to run SVM as a base classifier then use runTraining_SVM in the mainprogram. runTraining uses all classifiers.
